# Excel-VBA

## This is a collection of VBA scripts I coded

### 1. Filtering & Transferring Data from from one sheet to another
This script looks up column A in sheet "Sample Data" with an autofilter on, then it will run through all specified criterias, select the filtered data, and then copy-paste them onto the sheet "Reviewing"
